## [Motivation Behind Development](#motivation-behind-development)

Building new spark data engineering ETL/ELT pipeline from scratch is really hard and sometimes a bit deviating from final goal. 
Keeping hard eye on spark daily production implementation and hurdles leads to PROMPT.

### 1. Why PROMPT ?

Prompt is a modular framework for building fast, testable, scala spark application on top of any structured and structured data. Prompt provides an easy-to-use API for reading and writing data 
parallely as much as possible

### 2. How it is diffrent from other Frameworks ?

Currently, there is no frame work that works closely to SPARK and still provides ability to achieve large vision goals like designing a whole financial system or pipeline for aviation data flow pipeline.
